--- Abyssal Subworld ---
by GabeHasWon
commissioned by ThatOneMonkey369

Moves the Abyss biome from Homeward Journey into its own subworld, and removes it from the overworld.
You can access the Abyssal Subworld with a Diving Leech, dropped by the Diver boss.

The biome is shaped differently, and is directly exposed to open air. 
Aside from some adjustments - a few changes to give it a more natural look - the biome is 1:1 what it is in the base mod.
The biome is also persistent, and will save & load like a normal world.
